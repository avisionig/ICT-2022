In the following file, do not delete anything (comments, code, ...). Just add you code in every part (one per exercise).
Use my variable for input (if there is any), use my printing for output (if there is any).
You can upload your code to codepost.io to check the tests. A sucess in one test doesn't always mean than your exercise is correct,
a fail doesn't always mean that your exercise is wrong. I will check all codes.
At the end of exam, you should upload the last version of your code to codepost.io or to the online folder on Teams.
The only authorized packages are:
- pandas
- pyarrow
- fastparquet
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- datetime

# You have a model trained with one feature : feature1. Make a scatter plot with the feature as x axis and the label as y axis.
# Add on the same plot, the predictions of the model (line plot).You can find the required plot in the file Ex_4_plot_V18.png
